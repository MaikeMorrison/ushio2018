Although this theory has experimental support, evidence from natural ecosystems is lacking. Here, using tools for analysing nonlinear time series and a 12-year-long dataset of fortnightly collected observations on a natural marine fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, the show that short-term changes in interaction networks influence overall community dynamics. Figure 2 shows that interactions in the Maizuru Bay fish community are not static; this contradicts a common assumption of ecological research. Instead, they change over time, as expected for a system with nonlinear dynamics. Of the 14 interspecific interactions, on average 8 are negative and 6 are positive. â€¦</vt:lpwstr></property><property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="3" name="bibliography"><vt:lpwstr>references.bib</vt:lpwstr></property><property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="4" name="csl"><vt:lpwstr>../templates/journal-of-archaeological-science.csl</vt:lpwstr></property><property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="5" name="date"><vt:lpwstr>10 December, 2021</vt:lpwstr></property><property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="6" name="highlights"><vt:lpwstr>These are the highlights.</vt:lpwstr></property><property fmtid="{D5CDD505-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}" pid="7" name="output"><vt:lpwstr></vt:lpwstr></property></Properties>
